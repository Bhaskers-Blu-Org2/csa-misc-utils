Welcome to the "Getting Started with Azure Online Training" repo. This repo is designed to help you get started training on Azure fast. This is not all the training available. These trainings are self-paced, MOOC style courses. The courses listed here are what we see customer looking for as part of their digitial transformation. 

If you are new to Azure then we would suggest starting with [Microsoft Academy](./Microsoft_Academy#academy). Microsoft Academy is great place for learning the basics of Cloud. If you are an Apps or Infrastructure person start with "Cloud Administration". If you are a data, analytics, or BI person then we still suggest some of the courses of "Cloud Administration", then head quickly over to "Data Science" or "Big Data" to feel more at home.

We encourage you to watch or star this repo as more content/ training offerings will be added overtime. Feel free to even fork this repo for your own organization's github.

Let us know in the issues area if there are other trainings or content you would like to see. 

Finally, we do have a short URL for sharing this site with others: [aka.ms/AzureTrainingSites](https://aka.ms/AzureTrainingSites)
