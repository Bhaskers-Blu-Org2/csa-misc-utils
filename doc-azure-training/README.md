__Introduction__

Come back to this.
 
### Academy.Microsoft.com
__Overview__
 
Microsoft provides training tracks in partnership with EDX.org. edX.org are online self-paced courses on various topics.  For an easy to follow process, Microsoft has created tracks on https://academy.microsoft.com/
 
The eight (8) course tracks are:
 * Cloud Administration 
 * Data Science
 * Artificial Intelligence
 * Big Data 
 * DevOps
 * Front-End Web Development
 * Entry Level Software Development
 * IT Support
 
If you are looking for a place to start I would recommend Cloud Administration or DevOps if you have an Infrastructure or AppDev background, and Data Science or Big Data if you have a data background.
 
Most of these courses are developed by Microsoft. If Microsoft did not create the course but it is part of the track, then we have approved it.
 
Other Azure and Microsoft courses are available on edx.org. You will need a Microsoft account and an edX.org account to take these courses. In the next section we will walk through signing up for these accounts as well as getting started with your first course.
 
There are Microsoft Professional Program (MPP) Certificates tied to each track for a low cost.  All classes can be audited for free if the Certificate is not needed.  

 
__Signing up for a Microsoft Account__
 
Signing up for a Microsoft Account is simple and free. If you have a Microsoft Account, you can skip this section. A Microsoft Account is a Hotmail, Live, or Outlook account.
